It runs on [Plash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plash/id1494023538?mt=12) for macs with Sonoma+ and on [Hidamari](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.jeffshee.Hidamari) for flatpak capable linux distros with the gnome shell extensions dash to dock and just perfection on the Gnome Desktop Environment.

Requirements as of Oct/3/2024

Chromium Browser on a 1920x1080 capable PC or Mac with at least 2GB of VRAM
Chrome on Android with a modern Snapdragon chip.
